# busy_bee_spaces

# This is a static HTML website for a shared workspace. This website came about while developing a portfolio project for the Bootstrap class of my Nucamp bootcamp. The site is still a bit of a work in progress - for example, not all of the links in the navbar are active - but I really enjoyed utlizing what I had learned to create a site that seemed both calming and eye-catching.
